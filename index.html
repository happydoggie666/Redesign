                <p>
                    The website’s main problem is it has many (46) contrast errors and the heading hierarchy/structure  is very unclear. There are many redundant and small texts which are not easily recognizable. WAVE also finds that a nearby image contained in the website has the same alternative text, 
                    which cannot provide hints for the users of what the image is about if the image is not showing.

                <p>
                    I agree with the WAVE’s opinion that the website has  many contrast errors, the overly colorful page makes it hard for users to find something they are looking for efficiently. Although there are some icons which support affordance, it is still not that distinguishable. The page hierarchy is not clear enough. 
                    Many description texts are redundant. Also, the website seems to use  too many LING’s portraits and memes.

                        <p>To solve the "card brand logo display" not distinguishable problem, I use an image slider and put the car brand logo alphabetically so that people can scroll and search for the brand they like.

                        <p>In order to solve this problem, I designed a fixed top nav bar in my low-fidelity design. Although I twist the way I do it in my high-fidelity and the final implementation, 
                            I still find it useful to solve the issue when users want to go back to the menu and have to scroll up for quite a while to do so. It will improve the efficiency and the user experience.

                        <p>I add a filter function in my low-fidelity design. Although I didn’t implement it in my final version, it helps to filter out the redundant information.

                        <p>I adjust the cars gallery’s size and put each car in a flashcard. I add a hover animation to the car flashcard so that if people’s mouse moves to some specific cars, the car name would turn green and the car picture size would be **scaled to 0.9** of its original size. This makes it more clear where people are looking so that people won’t get lost and confused easily.

                        <p>In order for people to quickly return to the top, I add a “TOP button” which floats at the left-bottom of the screen and it will only show up when people scroll down more than 20px from the top.
                        </p>
                        <p>I decided to not do a fixed top nav bar and alternately choose this way, as I feel like this fits my design style better. Notice that this differs from my low-fidelity version.

                        <p>I use media queries + grid + flex box for many elements of my website(i.e. Search bar). To be specific, a media query judges whether a screen’s max-width is below 600px and the website will render differently based on this query.
