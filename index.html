            <p style="margin-bottom:10px;">Looking back, it is really bothersome to open a webpage which works fine on PC but is not user-friendly on phones or ipad. Imagine when you are really hungry and want to order food on a phone but the shop doesn’t really have an app. You click on the ordering link and find that everything is floating around. You spend a long time trying to figure out how to use it and where the order button is. Finally you successfully place an order but are also very exhausted.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:10px;">To avoid such a phenomenon,  from the user's perspective, the designer needs to create a product that will display and function properly (at least) most of the time - regardless of the size of the display and the type of device.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:10px;">Therefore, this project aims to design and build a responsive and user-friendly website in either usability, responsiveness or aesthetics aspects based on low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes of an existing interface. </p>

                <p>
                    The website’s main problem is it has many (46) contrast errors and the heading hierarchy/structure  is very unclear. There are many redundant and small texts which are not easily recognizable. WAVE also finds that a nearby image contained in the website has the same alternative text, 
                    which cannot provide hints for the users of what the image is about if the image is not showing.

                <p>
                    I agree with the WAVE’s opinion that the website has  many contrast errors, the overly colorful page makes it hard for users to find something they are looking for efficiently. Although there are some icons which support affordance, it is still not that distinguishable. The page hierarchy is not clear enough. 
                    Many description texts are redundant. Also, the website seems to use  too many LING’s portraits and memes.

                        <p>In order to solve this problem, I designed a fixed top nav bar in my low-fidelity design. Although I twist the way I do it in my high-fidelity and the final implementation, 
                            I still find it useful to solve the issue when users want to go back to the menu and have to scroll up for quite a while to do so. It will improve the efficiency and the user experience.

                        <p>I adjust the cars gallery’s size and put each car in a flashcard. I add a hover animation to the car flashcard so that if people’s mouse moves to some specific cars, the car name would turn green and the car picture size would be **scaled to 0.9** of its original size. This makes it more clear where people are looking so that people won’t get lost and confused easily.

          <p> <p style="margin-top:3%; margin-bottom:3%"><strong>For the project display page, I received the following suggestions: </strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>The jumping hover effect is a little bit distracting where things keep on jumping up at you unexpectedly.</li>
                <li>It would be nice to have the annotations on the wireframes (low-fidelity prototype and high-fidelity prototype) itself. The annotations should be pointing to the exact area on the website to make it easier to understand how I built my redesigned website.</li>
                <li>The image in the high-fidelity design session loads very slowly. I could consider compressing some of them and rearrange the layout.</li>
            </ol>
           </p>

           <p> <p style="margin-top:3%; margin-bottom:3%"><strong>For the responsive design page itself, I received the following suggestions: </strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Only having 2 cars per row in the Cars / Vans sections is too few where the images are too large and will cause people to scroll a lot when a lot of cars are present.</li>
                <li>
                    <p style="margin-bottom:2%">The website didn’t really become responsive in the iphone viewpoint. Some texts were cut off. The redesigned page for the mobile layout was hard to navigate as the car brand images and car images were very large.</p>
                    <p>To adjust this, I would re-define the media query constraint to make it more adjustable to the iphone setting. Or maybe I will remake a react page for this one instead of an html+css page.</p>
                </li>
                <li>I could add a hamburger menu to make my website more responsive for smaller screen sizes.</li>
            </ol>
